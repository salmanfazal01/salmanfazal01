## 💬 Fun Facts & ⚡️ Extras  
- ☕ I believe a perfect dev stack is like a perfect shot of espresso: strong, smooth, no jitters.  
- I’ve built my own micro-SDKs and internal packages, because sometimes open-source isn’t enough — you make your own.  
- Web3 isn’t a fad for me — I’m obsessed with good UX in crypto (wallet connect flows, gasless UX, educational platforms).  
- If code were melodies, I’d remix Figma designs like DJ drops.
